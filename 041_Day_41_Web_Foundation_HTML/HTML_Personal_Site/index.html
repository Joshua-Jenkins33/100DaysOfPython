        <br>
        <p>I'm a husband, father, member of The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, and Data Engineer. I've got two happy golden retrievers and love to spend my free time working on 100 Days of Code, tackling a mountain peak, visiting family, swimming, playing Dungeons and Dragons, and occasionally hanging out in World of Warcraft.</p>
