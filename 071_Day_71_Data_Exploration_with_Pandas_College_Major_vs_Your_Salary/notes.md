# Day 71: Data Exploration with Pandas: College Major v.s. Your Salary
Learn Data Exploration with Pandas by Analysing the Post-University Salaries of Graduates by Major 

College degrees are *very* expensive. But, do they pay you back? Choosing Philosophy or International Relations as a major may have worried your parents, but does the data back up their fears? PayScale Inc. did a year-long survey of 1.2 million Americans with only a bachelor's degree. We'll be digging into this data and use Pandas to answer these questions: 
- Which degrees have the highest starting salaries? 
- Which majors have the lowest earnings after college?
- Which degrees have the highest earning potential?
- What are the lowest risk college majors from an earnings standpoint?
- Do business, STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, Mathematics) or HASS (Humanities, Arts, Social Science) degrees earn more on average? 

Today you'll learn 
- How to explore a Pandas DataFrame
- How to detect NaN (not a number) values and clean your data
- How to select particular columns, rows, and individual cells
- How to sort your data
- How to group data by category

and so much more! Let's get started!

## Getting Set Up for Data Science
**Introducing the Google Colab Notebook**

PyCharm is a fantastic IDE, but when we're exploring and visualising a dataset, you'll find the Python notebook format better suited.

Open your first Google Colab Notebook in through your [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/). You can find the Python Notebook under New → More → Google Colaboratory

If you cannot access the Google Colab Notebooks or would like to run everything locally on your computer, then I recommend [installing Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual) and using the bundled Jypyter Notebook instead. Either way works. Google Colab is essentially just an online version of Jupyter. 

**How to use a Python Notebook**
The notebook is divided into cells. Each cell can be executed individually and the result is automatically printed out below. To execute a cell use the shortcut **Shift + Enter**. 

*Note:* The Google Colab Notebook will to connect to a Runtime in order to execute any code.


That's pretty much it. Let's get started!
