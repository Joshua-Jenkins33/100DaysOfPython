# Day 43: Web Foundation CSS

## Introduction to CSS
Cascading Style Sheets!

You can't get super pretty with just HTML. HTML is really wordy to handle page layout. You have to use tables. Yuck.
Tables are easy to make syntax errors. It's also difficult to debug. Embedding tables within tables is a horrible mess.

CCS can't really do anything by itself. They're pretty much just for styling and making things look nice.

## Inline CSS
Change the background! 

Inject CSS into the tag we want to affect. To change the background, we'll modify the `<body>` tag.

The `style=""` attribute injects CSS into the HTML file.

```html
<body style="background-color: blue;">
</body>
```

Go to [colorhunt.co](colorhunt.co) for sweet colors.

```html
<body style="background-color: #F1EEE9;">
</body>
```
