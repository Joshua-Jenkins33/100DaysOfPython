# Day 76: Advanced - Computation with NumPy and N-Dimensional Arrays

# What We'll Make
No Data Science course can be complete without learning NumPy (Numerical Python). NumPy is a Python library thatâ€™s used in almost every field of science and engineering. Itâ€™s practically **THE** standard for working with numerical data in Python. The case studies for how NumPy is being used speak for themselves ðŸ˜®

So far, weâ€™ve been using Pandas, which is built on top of NumPy. Think of Pandas as a high-level data manipulation tool that includes functionality for working with time-series or for grouping, joining, merging and finding missing data (i.e., everything weâ€™ve been doing so far). NumPy on the other hand shines with low-level tasks, like doing serious math and calculations.

**Today we'll learn:**
- How to leverage the power ðŸ’ª of NumPy's ndarrays
- How to access individual values and subsets inside an n-dimensional array.
- How broadcasting ðŸ“£ works with ndarrays.
- How to do linear algebra with NumPy.
- How to generate points that you can plot on a chart.
- How to manipulate images as ndarrays.
