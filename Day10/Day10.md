# Day 10 Functions with Outputs

Building a Calculator application!

## More Functions!!

A review below!

```py
def my_function():
    #Do this
    #Then do this
    #Finally do this
```

Second thing we worked over!

```py
def my_function(something):
    #Do this with something
    #Then do this
    #Finally do this
```

### Functions with Outputs

```py
def my_function():
    result = 3*2
    return result
    # output = my_function() (output replaces the function call; very end variable output will store whatever the output is)
```

**return** outputs the result. 

Think of them like a machine. Empty bottles. Function. Out comes a bottle of milk. Processes or code to create change.
