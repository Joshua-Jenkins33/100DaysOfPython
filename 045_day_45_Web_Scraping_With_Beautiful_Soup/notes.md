# Day 45: Intermediate+ Web Scraping with Beautiful Soup
Some websites don't have APIs, or their APIs don't allow us to do all of the things that we want to do. So this is where we start thinking about using web scraping where we look through the underlying HTML code to get the information we want.

`BeautifulSoup` is a module that helps developers make sense of websites. Websites are like soup and rather convoluted and complex. If you want to make sense of a webpage and pull out the relevant parts of the data, then you'll need an HTML parser like BeautifulSoup. This enables you to find and pull out the HTML elements that you're interested in from this soup of jumbled HTML code.

Once we've mastered this skill, we will be able to take data from any website.
