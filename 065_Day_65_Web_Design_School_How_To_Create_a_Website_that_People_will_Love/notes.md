# Day 65: Web Design Schoolâ€”How to Create a Website that People will Love

## Introduction to Web Design

The 4 Pillars are Color Theory, Typography, User Interface and UX Design.

She used an example of a kids juice box company with an awful web design. She asked people how much they'd be willing to pay for the juice; most respondents said they'd maybe spend a dollar. 

She showed the same company's website redesigned by a professional and asked how much they'd be willing to pay. $3. That's a 300% increase.

## Understanding the Color Theory

Red conveys love, energy, intensity.
Yellow is about joy, intellect, and attention. It's attention grabbing; impossible not to look at something that's very yellow. It can be too attention grabbing. 
Green. Freshness, growth, safety. It's edible. 
Blue. Stability, trust, serenity. (Wear blue to an interview)
Purple. Royalty, wealth, feminity.

It's a conscious decision; what message am I trying to convey to the user?

It's usually not 1 color; it's two or three. You have to decide which colors to combine. This is the most scientific part of Color Theory. You often want analagous colors on the palette. They are harmonious and work well together.

Great for navigation bars, body of website, logo and background.

It's not good at standing out. You're better off grabbing opposite colors, creating a complementary or clashing color palette. It makes things pop.

Fake greenery between meat in the grocery store causes a pop. Conveys freshness, too.

Don't style text and text background with it. It's jarring. Keep it to logos or icons.

Other ways to combine colors: draw an equilateral triangle or a square. Go to Adobe Color to get different palettes.

## Understanding Typography and How to Choose Fonts
Fonts matter! They create a move and create a slick design (especially when mixed and matched!).

There are **serif** and **non-serif**. 

Serif has the **feet**. Comes from carvings in stone. This is more serious, authoritative, formal, intellectual.

Serif has smaller subfamilies like:
- Old Style
- Transitional
- Modern
- Slab

e.g. Winery - Old Style

You can tell how "old" a serif font is by the exaggeration difference between the thickets and thinnest parts of the font characters. Modern ones have greater exaggerations.

### The Emotion Behind Fonts

***Serif**
- Traditional
  - Minion Pro
- Stable
  - Trojan
- Respectable
  - Baskerville

**Sans-Serif**
- Sensible
  - Helvetica
- Simple
  - Avenir
- Straightforward
  - Din
  
***Script***
- Personal
  - Freestyle Script
- Creative
  - Adios Script Pro
- Elegant
  - Snell Roundhand

***Display***
- Friendly 
  - Vag Rounded
- LOUD
  - Gin
- Amusing
  - Thirsty Rought

***Modern***
- Stylish
  - Sackers Gothic
- Chic
  - Gotham
- Smart
  - Futura

Things to look at with fonts:
- Open shapes
- Ample character spacing
- Unambiguous forms (does a g look like a 9?)
- Varying proportions (does a O look like 0?)

Recommendation: Use just 2 fonts in 1 design. Looks cleaner and tighter. You want to go for similar moods and time era. You can contrast serif-ness to create more interest in your design. Weights can also be used!

Examples:
- Mood -- Andes/bougan
- Time Era -- Garamond/Ocean Sans Std
- Serif-ness -- Myriad/Minion
- Weights -- GENEVA/Dallas

The following fonts are really tough to make look good:
- Comic Sans
- Kristen
- Webdings
- Curlz
- Viner
- Papyrus


## Manage ATTENTION with effective User Interface (UI) Design

### 1. Hierarchy

The most important information gets conveyed over first and I make sure that the reader ingests what I want them to.

We can create hierarchy in a number of ways. One of those is **Color**.

__Color__
Contrasting colors are used for high hierarchy.

__Size__
Bigger items often draw your eyes to it.

### 2. Layout (In addition to Hierarchy)
  
Intersperse your block of text with shapes and images. Wikipedia is a bad example of this. There's an optimal line length (40-60 characters per line so it feels comfortable for the user). You get through more of it and take more in.

### 3. Alignment

How you position each element on the screen relative to each other.

Keep the alignment the same!

Reduce the number of alignment points. 

### 4. White Space
The empty space around your elements/text. Luxury designer stores use white space around their products to make it look more expensive. A lot of product on show makes it look like a discount store. Minimalist and elevated.

### 5. Audience
Design for your audience! Allow for flexibility. Creating a style *for a particular audience*. 

## User Experience (UX) Design
UX is best explained by the renovation of a college. They hired a renowned architect to come in and design it. He got all the buildings taken care of but didn't lay down a sidewalk design. He said "I'll come back next year and we'll know where the paths need to go."

This is the difference between UX and design. Design is what we think looks good and thereby forcing it on the user. Experience is meant to be invisible and unobtrusive. We want it to be easy and everything is effortless.

1. Simplicity
   - Always better than making more complex or more cluttered
2. Consistency
   - Keep your designs and functionality consistent
   - Inconsistency means the user will get confused and have bad experiences (xfinity and different offerings)
3. Reading Patters
   - Eye starts at top left then flicks back browsing down the left gutter; have everything follow this pattern
   - Or use the Z-Layout, left to right, down left to right
      - Used in Facebook
4. All Platform Design
   - Not enough for it to just go on a Desktop
   - Needs to be mobile responsive
   - Needs the content to be rearranged based on screen size

***AVOID*** having so many banners that show up on your mobile that your content becomes hard to ingest.

Test, test, test.

5. Don't Use Your Powers for Evil
  - Dark Patterns
    - Get a user to perform a behavior that is beneficial for the company or the designer but it's not what the user wants (bad user experience)
    - Tricking people is **bad**
